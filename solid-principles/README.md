# Main Goal

SOLID is an acronym that stands for five principles that you should follow to not put your feet into possible software development bugs and issues.
Let's review the step by step with some real examples.
NOTE: Our goal is to write code that adheres to the dependency inversion principle. This means that we should "depend upon Abstractions and do not depend upon concretions".

## Concepts:
- SoC - Separation of Concerns principle
Concerns are the different aspects of software functionality.
- SOLID Principles:
-- Single responsibility principle
-- Open Closed principle
-- Liskov Substitution principle
-- Interface Segregation principle
-- Dependency Inversion principle
- NOTE:  When two pieces of code look alike, it doesnâ€™t always mean that they are the same thing.
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
